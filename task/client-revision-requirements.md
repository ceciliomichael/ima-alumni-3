1. User Authentication & Login System

Alumni will authenticate using their LRN (Learner's Reference Number) as their username, along with a password.

Initial passwords will be generated and distributed by administrators/officers, following the format: [lastname]2025 (e.g., smith2025).

Users will have the ability to change their password from within their profile settings after logging in.

Administrators retain the privilege to manually reset a user's password if requested.

2. Dynamic Landing Page Configuration

Administrators will have access to edit the main welcome message on the landing page. The default text will be:

"Once an Immaculatian, always an Immaculatian! Proud to be part of Immaculate Mary Academy, where dreams begin and success continues. Forever grateful for the memories and lessons!"

An animated carousel will be featured on the landing page to showcase Alumni Officers. Each entry in the carousel must display the officer's image, full name, and official title (e.g., President, Vice President).

3. Public Access Controls

The website will be publicly accessible, but guest users (non-logged-in visitors) will have view-only access to a limited set of pages:

Landing Page (Home)

History

Vision & Mission

Donation Progress Overview

Privacy Note: The public donation progress will show only the total amount or overall progress toward goals. Individual donor identities and specific donation purposes will remain private.

4. Donation Tracking & Reporting

All donation records will be automatically archived and categorized by month and year.

The administrator dashboard will include filtering options to generate reports based on specific months and years.

5. Interactive "About Us" Section

The "About Us" page will be an interactive module with a sleek animation. Users will navigate through the following content panels using left and right arrows:

History

Mission

Vision

Organizational Chart

Contact Information

6. Themed UI/UX Design

The primary background color of the website will be updated to a blue that is brand-consistent with the official logo.

All primary call-to-action buttons will be styled with a yellow that matches the accent color in the logo.

7. Automated Event Notifications

A system will be implemented to automatically send email notifications to all registered users whenever a new event is posted and published by an administrator. This ensures users are alerted across both desktop and mobile platforms.

8. Email Service Integration

A free or cost-effective email API (e.g., SendGrid, EmailJS) will be integrated to manage all transactional emails for the system, primarily for password reset and recovery workflows.

9. Administrative Content Moderation

A pre-approval workflow will be enforced for all user-generated content. Any content submitted by alumni (e.g., posts, comments, event submissions) must be reviewed and approved by an administrator before being visible on the public-facing site.
