# IMA Alumni Platform – Implementation Memory

This document captures the full history of changes we implemented for the Immaculate Mary Academy (IMA) Alumni platform as part of the requested revisions and subsequent enhancements.

## Overview
- Shifted to a name-based authentication flow (no registration). Users log in by entering their full name.
- Ensured active alumni can always access: if a user record doesn’t exist, it is auto-provisioned based on an active alumni record.
- Updated branding and homepage experience to focus on Immaculate Mary Academy (IMA), removed social media-like features (Share, Following), and added donation progress.
- Improved admin experience: removed pending registrations workflow and added a “Clear All Data” control that actually clears Firebase collections.
- Fixed multiple bugs, including Firestore errors due to undefined payload fields and import path issues.

## Key Milestones (Chronological)
1. Created a detailed implementation plan (`plan.md`).
2. Implemented name-based login with normalization and alumni fallback.
3. Reworked login UI to single “Full Name” input, removed legacy register/forgot flows.
4. Updated layout branding to use the full name “Immaculate Mary Academy (IMA) Alumni”.
5. Modernized header layout to handle long names gracefully.
6. Simplified home feed: removed “Following” and “Share” actions.
7. Added `IMAHeroCard` and `DonationProgressCard` and wired them into the homepage.
8. Removed admin pending registrations page entirely (routes, nav, and component).
9. Added “Clear All Data” to the admin dashboard and ensured it deletes Firebase collections.
10. Fixed post creation error by removing undefined fields before Firestore writes.

## Feature Details

### Name-Based Authentication
- New service: `src/services/auth/nameLoginService.ts`
  - `normalizeFullName(value)`: trims, collapses whitespace, and lowercases input for consistent matching.
  - `findActiveUsersByExactName(name)`: searches `users` for exact active matches (normalized).
  - `findActiveAlumniByExactName(name)`: searches `alumni_records` for exact active matches (normalized).
  - `ensureUserFromAlumniRecord(alumni)`: if alumni has no user, auto-provisions a minimal active user and links it; if user exists but inactive, auto-approves.
  - `loginByName(name)`: tries users first; if none, falls back to alumni and provisions/approves as needed; supports multiple-match selection.
  - `loginWithSelectedUser(user)`: logs in a user from multiple matches.

- User service updates: `src/services/firebase/userService.ts`
  - Added `createUser(payload)` to support auto-provisioning.
  - Prevented Firestore writes with `undefined` optional fields (`batch`, `profileImage`, `coverPhoto`).

### Login UI/UX
- `src/pages/Auth/LoginPage.tsx` changed to a single “Full Name” field and integrated with name-based login.
- `src/pages/Auth/Auth.css` cleaned up obsolete elements and added styles for multiple-match selection.
- `src/App.tsx`
  - Redirects `/register` to `/login`.
  - Later removed `/admin/pending-registrations` route entirely.

### Branding and Header
- `src/components/Layout/Layout.tsx`: Updated branding text to “Immaculate Mary Academy (IMA) Alumni”.
- `src/components/Layout/Layout.css`: Reworked header for long-name responsiveness
  - Increased header height and spacing, centered nav, pill-style nav container.
  - Added truncation/ellipsis for the logo text, improved mobile breakpoints, and polished interactions.

### Homepage Experience
- `src/pages/Home/HomePage.tsx`: Removed “Following” view and its logic; added `IMAHeroCard` above feed.
- `src/pages/Home/components/PostList/PostList.tsx`: Removed “Share” action and related logic/state.
- `src/pages/Home/components/IMAHero/IMAHeroCard.tsx` + `IMAHeroCard.css`: New hero introducing IMA with subtle stats and actions.
- `src/pages/Home/components/Sidebar/DonationProgressCard.tsx` + `DonationProgressCard.css`:
  - Displays raised amount vs goal with progress bar and donors count.
  - Fixed an import path issue for `donationService`.
- `src/pages/Home/components/Sidebar/SidebarRight.tsx`: Integrated `DonationProgressCard` at the top.

### Admin – Pending Registrations Removal
- `src/App.tsx`: Removed route and component for `/admin/pending-registrations`.
- `src/pages/Admin/layout/AdminLayout.tsx`: Removed the sidebar link and unused `UserPlus` import.
- `src/pages/Admin/components/AlumniRecords/index.tsx`: Removed `PendingRegistrations` export.
- Deleted file: `src/pages/Admin/components/AlumniRecords/PendingRegistrations.tsx`.

### Admin – Clear All Data (Firebase) 
- `src/pages/Admin/components/Dashboard/Dashboard.tsx`:
  - Added “System Management” card with a destructive “Clear All Data” button and confirmation dialog.
  - The operation now deletes ALL data from Firebase collections (posts, users, events, jobs, gallery items, alumni records, officers, donations, contact messages), then clears localStorage (preserving admin session key) and re-initializes client-side service shapes.
  - Moved the card to the bottom of the dashboard by request.
- `src/pages/Admin/components/Dashboard/Dashboard.css`: Added design for the System Management card.

### Post Creation – Firestore Undefined Field Fix
- Issue: Firestore rejected `undefined` in `feeling` during `addDoc()`.
- Fixes:
  - `src/pages/Home/components/PostForm/PostForm.tsx`: Only includes `feeling` and `userImage` when present; no `undefined` values are sent.
  - `src/services/firebase/postService.ts`: Added a sanitizer to strip `undefined` fields from payloads before Firestore writes.

## Bug Fixes
- Donation progress import path corrected in `DonationProgressCard.tsx`.
- Name matching robustness with whitespace collapse and case-insensitive comparison.
- Firestore write safety by removing `undefined` fields (user creation and posts).
- Removed all references to now-deleted pending registrations to prevent build/runtime errors.

## Behavioral Notes / Breaking Changes
- User registration route is disabled; `/register` now redirects to `/login`.
- Name-based login requires exact name match after normalization (whitespace collapse and lowercase comparison). In case of duplicates, users pick their profile.
- Auto-provisioning creates minimal active user records for active alumni without linked users.
- Admin “Clear All Data” will delete data from Firebase collections; admin session is preserved in localStorage for continuity.

## Acceptance Criteria Coverage
- Login without registration via name-based auth – implemented.
- Use of dummy data for member details while using real names – supported.
- Homepage uses the full school name “Immaculate Mary Academy (IMA)” – implemented.
- Share and Following removed – implemented.
- Donation progress displayed – implemented.

## Known Considerations / Next Steps
- Validate with real alumni names to confirm matching and duplicate handling meet expectations (e.g., “Michael Cecilio”, “John Doe”).
- Consider an admin safeguard to skip deleting specific system users in Firebase during “Clear All Data” (currently session is preserved rather than doc whitelisting).
- Optional: Add server-side text search or an index-backed search for large user datasets.

## Latest Update: Color Scheme Refresh (Current Session)

### Implementation Summary
- Updated the entire color system per client specifications:
  - Primary: #31c1fd (Light Sky Blue)
  - Primary Dark: #1b9cd8 (for hover/active states)
  - Secondary: #fe6a20 (Orange)
  - Background: #fefefe (Near White)
  - Text Primary: #000000 (Black)

### Files Modified
- `src/index.css` – Updated all CSS variables in `:root` to new palette; replaced all rgba references with `rgba(var(--primary-rgb), alpha)` pattern.
- `src/components/Layout/Layout.css` – Replaced hard-coded brand colors with variables; updated logo gradient to primary→secondary.
- `src/pages/Auth/Auth.css` – Updated illustration gradient to use primary→primary-dark.
- `src/pages/Home/Home.css` – Updated feed tab active state to use primary rgb variables.
- `src/pages/Home/components/IMAHero/IMAHeroCard.css` – Replaced purple gradient with primary→secondary gradient.
- `src/pages/Home/components/Sidebar/DonationProgressCard.css` – Updated donation icon and progress bar to use primary→secondary gradient.
- `src/pages/Admin/components/Dashboard/Dashboard.css` – Updated subtle overlays to use new primary color variables.

### Key Changes
- All gradients now use the primary→secondary color combination for brand consistency.
- Hover states consistently use `--primary-dark` (#1b9cd8).
- Focus rings and alpha overlays use `rgba(var(--primary-rgb), alpha)` pattern.
- Text contrast optimized for accessibility on the new near-white background.
- Removed all hard-coded purple/indigo references (#4f46e5, #7c3aed, etc.).

### Login Illustration & Branding Tweaks (Current Session)
- Added alumni logo on the right-side illustration area in the login split screen (`src/pages/Auth/LoginPage.tsx`) with dedicated styles in `src/pages/Auth/Auth.css`.
- Replaced the login illustration with a custom high-contrast SVG: `public/images/alumni-connection.svg` (dark background, bright elements, rounded 20px corners) for premium look and strong contrast.
- Fixed hero logo visibility by removing the white-inverting filter from `.ima-hero-logo` in `src/pages/Home/components/IMAHero/IMAHeroCard.css`.

### Files Created (Current Session)
- `public/images/alumni-connection.svg` – custom alumni connection illustration (dark theme, rounded background).

### Files Modified (Additional in This Session)
- `src/pages/Auth/LoginPage.tsx` – added illustration-side logo and switched illustration to the new SVG.
- `src/pages/Auth/Auth.css` – added `.illustration-logo` styles; kept focus/brand colors aligned to new tokens.
- `src/pages/Home/components/IMAHero/IMAHeroCard.css` – updated gradient to new palette; removed logo invert filter.

### Client Feedback Iterations
- Increased SVG contrast; switched to a dark themed background and added rounded corners for a modern, polished frame.
- Ensured login and hero logos render with original colors (no unintended white inversion).
